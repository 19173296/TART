# TART FPGA Overview

The FPGA synchronizes all the incoming radio signals, buffers them and exposes an SPI interface to the host computer to retrieve raw data,
visibilities and also to configure the system.

## Real-Time correlator

The FPGA also acts as a real-time correlator, calculating visibilities on-the-fly.
