At the moment TART consists of three different PCBs:

1. (24x) Radio module (RF front end)
2. (4x) Radio hub module (jitter cleaner, power supply, 485 transceiver and base for 6 Radio modules)
3. (1x) Base station module (485 transceiver, oscillator, power supply, host for acquisition FPGA and Raspberry Pi)

base_station, radio_hub_module and radio_module are the original designs used for all currently built up TART's (as of Feb 2019). The base_station folder is a KIcad project, while radio_hub_module and radio_module are created in Eagle PCB.

The *201902 folder are the above converted and updated to KIcad 5 projects.

BOM html and CSV files are included. These are generated by the github.com:SchrodingersGat/KiBoM.git plugin.
